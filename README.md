# My third lab for the subject "Information theory" :closed_lock_with_key:

:mortar_board: I did this lab in the second year of university in the fourth semester.

:computer: This program was written using Visual Studio 2019, Windows Forms (for GUI), .NET Core 3.1, __C#__.

- This program can encrypt and decrypt files of any type like:
    - .txt
    - .jpg
    - .png
